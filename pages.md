# Page Documentation
have uploaded a full documentation file (pages.md) describing a Laravel CMS structure for dynamic frontend pages. The pages are built in Blade (home.blade.php) and Vue (/js/pages/*) and get their content from the database.

The file includes:

Page and section layout structures

Content schemas in JSON

Database tables: create a relevant database that has : pages, sections,, etc 

API endpoints mapped to views

Please:

ðŸ§± Backend Setup
Generate Laravel migrations for pages, sections, and section_images based on the file.

Create seeders that populate data matching the example content in the JSON blocks.

Set up Eloquent models with relationships.

Build Repositories and Services for fetching content by slug or section name.

Implement Controllers to serve these APIs (e.g., /api/home/sections, /api/about/sections).

Create API routes grouped under /api that serve dynamic JSON for all frontend pages.

ðŸ–¼ Frontend Integration
Show how to use these API endpoints in:

Blade: Example in home.blade.php using @json($sections) or similar

Vue: Example using axios to call APIs and bind to data
